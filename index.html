    <div class="centered row">
            <p>CHURP enables secure <b>secret-sharing</b> in <b>dynamic</b> settings, where the committee of nodes storing a secret changes over time. Designed for blockchains, CHURP has lower communication complexity than previous schemes. </p> 
    </div>

    <div class="centered row"><h2 class="ui header"><i class="question circle icon"></i>Why use CHURP?</h2></div>
    <div class="centered row"> <p> At the heart of decentralized systems today is a demoralizing irony. Vast resources---intellect, equipment, and energy---go into avoiding centralized control and creating "trustless" systems like Bitcoin. But hapless users then defeat the whole purpose of these systems by handing over their private keys to centralized entities like Coinbase. Or worse still, they lose their keys, sending approximately $12 billion in cryptocurrency to date into the celestial dustbin. </p> 

     <p> Wouldn't it be nice if there were instead a system that: (1) Made user key management easier and (2) Was itself actually decentralized? And, even better, what if it could: (3) Manage keys for entities that can't store secrets, such as smart contracts? </p>

     <p> You guessed it, CHURP achieves all the above goals. Read more about it in the ePrint version (link above)! </p>
